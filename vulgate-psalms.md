title: Translations of the Psalms from the Vulgate
permalink: /vulgate-psalms/
...

While much of the Latin translation of the Bible common in the Middle Ages, typically called the Vulgate, was translated by Jerome from the Hebrew, other parts were only light revisions of earlier Latin translations, collectively referred to as the Old Latin Bible, which were often made from the Septuagint (abbreviated LXX), an early translation from Hebrew into Greek. The 'Gallican Psalter' was the most common text of the Psalms in the Middle Ages, and was one of these revisions; it can sometimes differ significantly from the Hebrew. (While Jerome made a new Latin translation of the Psalms into Hebrew, it was only used for scholarly purposes in the Middle Ages.) See the [New English Translation of the Septuagint](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/) for a direct translation from the Greek to English.

## Psalm 1, *Beatus uir qui non abiit*

([Utrecht Psalter, pp. 11–12](http://objects.library.uu.nl/reader/index.php?obj=1874-284427&lan=en#page//46/00/19/46001949193835361873338121333815278268.jpg/mode/1up); [Harley Psalter, fols. 1v–2r](http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=harley_ms_603_f001v); [Eadwine Psalter, fols. 5v–6r](http://sites.trin.cam.ac.uk/manuscripts/r_17_1/manuscript.php?fullpage=1&startingpage=12))

<sup>1</sup>Blessed is the man who has not passed in the counsel of the ungodly,  
and has not stood in the way of sinners:  
and has not sat in the seat of disease.

<sup>2</sup>But his desire is in the law of the Lord:  
and on his law will he meditate day and night.

<sup>3</sup>And he will be like a tree  
that was planted by the course of the waters,  
which will give its fruit at its proper time,  
and its leaf will not droop;  
and everything whatever he does will prosper.

<sup>4</sup>Not so the ungodly: not so;  
but they are like dust, which the wind casts from the face of the earth.

<sup>5</sup>Therefore the ungodly will not rise in the judgement;  
nor the sinners in the counsel of the righteous.

<sup>6</sup>For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,  
and the way of the ungodly will perish.

## Psalm 4, *Cum inuocarem*

([Utrecht Psalter, pp. 12–13](http://objects.library.uu.nl/reader/index.php?obj=1874-284427&lan=en#page//91/97/65/91976564053086137379038748336320714509.jpg/mode/1up); [Harley Psalter, fols. 2v–3r](http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=harley_ms_603_f002v); [Eadwine Psalter, fols. 9r–9v](http://sites.trin.cam.ac.uk/manuscripts/r_17_1/manuscript.php?fullpage=1&startingpage=19))

<sup>1</sup>*Until the end. Among the songs. A psalm of David.*

<sup>2</sup>When I was calling, the God of my righteousness heard me.  
You exalted me in my trouble;  
have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.

<sup>3</sup>You sons of men, how long will you be heavy-hearted?  
Why do you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?

*Diapsalm*

<sup>4</sup>And know that the Lord has made marvellous his holy one.  
The Lord will hear me when I cry out to him.

<sup>5</sup>Be angry, and do not sin;  
for what you speak in your hearts,  
feel remorse on your beds.

*Diapsalm*

<sup>6</sup>Sacrifice a sacrifice of righteousness, and hope in the Lord.  
Many say, 'Who will show us good things?'

<sup>7</sup>The light of your face has been sealed on us, O Lord;  
you have given gladness in my heart.

<sup>8</sup>From the fruit of their grain and wine and oil they multiplied.

<sup>9</sup>In peace, in the very same, I will sleep and rest:  
<sup>10</sup>for you only, Lord, have settled me in hope.

## Psalm 50 (51), *Miserere mei, Deus*

([Utrecht Psalter, pp. 65–66](http://objects.library.uu.nl/reader/index.php?obj=1874-284427&lan=en#page//10/06/19/100619803724793270162039958413564368089.jpg/mode/1up); [Eadwine Psalter, fols. 88v–90v](http://sites.trin.cam.ac.uk/manuscripts/r_17_1/manuscript.php?fullpage=1&startingpage=178))

<sup>1</sup>*Until the end. A psalm of David,* <sup>2</sup>*when Nathan the prophet came to him, when David went into Bathsheba.*

<sup>3</sup>Have mercy on me, O God, according to your great compassion:  
and according to the multitude of your mercies destroy my wickedness.

<sup>4</sup>Wash me throughly from my wickedness:  
and cleanse me from my sin.

<sup>5</sup>For I myself acknowledge my faults:  
and my sin is always against me.

<sup>6</sup>Against you only have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight,  
that you may be justified in your sayings,  
and prevail when you are judged.

<sup>7</sup>For behold, I was conceived in wickednesses:  
and in sin my mother conceived me.

<sup>8</sup>For behold, you have loved truth;  
you have shown me the uncertain and secret aspects of your wisdom.

<sup>9</sup>You will sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed;  
you will wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

<sup>10</sup>In my hearing you will give joy and gladness;  
humbled bones will rejoice.

<sup>11</sup>Turn your face from my sins,  
and destroy all my wickednesses.

<sup>12</sup>Create a clean heart in me, O God,  
and renew a right spirit in my innermost parts.

<sup>13</sup>Do not cast me away from your face:  
and do not take your holy spirit from me.

<sup>14</sup>Give me the gladness of your salvation again:  
and strengthen me with a princely spirit.

<sup>15</sup>I will teach your ways to the wicked:  
and the ungodly will be converted to you.

<sup>16</sup>Deliver me from bloodshed, O God, the God of my health:  
and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness.

<sup>17</sup>O Lord, you will open my lips,  
and my mouth will bring forth your praise.

<sup>18</sup>For if you desired a sacrifice, in that case I would have given it;  
you will not delight in whole burnt offerings.

<sup>19</sup>Sacrifice to God is a troubled spirit;  
God will not despise a crushed and humbled heart.

<sup>20</sup>Kindly establish Sion, O Lord, in your good will;  
and let the walls of Jerusalem be built.

<sup>21</sup>Then will you accept the sacrifice of righteousness,  
the oblations and whole burnt offerings;  
then will they place young animals on your altar.

## Psalm 109 (110), *Dixit Dominus*

([Utrecht Psalter, pp. 136–137](http://objects.library.uu.nl/reader/index.php?obj=1874-284427&lan=en#page//72/52/45/72524522942408603628769022993318784925.jpg/mode/1up); [Harley Psalter, fols. 56v–57r](http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=harley_ms_603_f056v); [Eadwine Psalter, fols. 199v–200r](http://sites.trin.cam.ac.uk/manuscripts/r_17_1/manuscript.php?fullpage=1&startingpage=400))

<sup>1</sup>*A hymn of David.*

The Lord said unto my Lord: ‘Sit on my right,  
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.’

<sup>2</sup>The Lord will send the rod of your power out of Sion:  
rule in the midst of your enemies.

<sup>3</sup>With you is the rule on the day of your strength,  
among the splendours of the holy ones;  
from the womb, before the morning star, I brought you forth.

<sup>4</sup>The Lord swore, and will not change his mind:  
‘You are a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.’

<sup>5</sup>The Lord at your right has broken kings in the day of his wrath.

<sup>6</sup>He will judge among the nations; he will fulfil the dead bodies:  
he will shatter heads on the land of many.

<sup>7</sup>He will drink from the rushing stream in the way:  
therefore he will lift up his head.
